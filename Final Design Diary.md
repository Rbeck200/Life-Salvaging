In this project I feel as if I bit off a bit more than I could chew. I had this grandiose Idea of a full fledged mini RPG, but only after not being abole to make my own max
priority queue I was forced to use the prority queue from the last assignment, which I just kept the same, but as I started doing more into the battle I realized that both 
parts for my game were only half finished. As I was finishing my first town I realized that I would have to rewrite then entire game to make inventories, quests, and the 
players stats transfer from scene to scene. This is a very frustrating experience for me because I would normally have people to talk to directly after class, I dont know. 
The quarentine has hit me really hard. At least when we were in class it hard/terrible together, but now its hard/terrible alone and its hard to cope.

BTW the terrible is in remark to 243 not your class.
