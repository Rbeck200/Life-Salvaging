# Life-Salvaging
A 2D RPG about keeping towns connected through a war.


The Kingdom of Elth is under seige by Handrof, land of the demons. This is the story of Lief Erricson the only one fast, and stupid, enough to make sure that supply lines between towns dont end like they did last time the Handrof attacked.

Make your way through wild lands to bring supplies, information, and hope back to the people of this land.
