# Life-Salvaging
A 2D RPG about keeping towns connected through a war.


The Kingdom of Elth is under seige by Handrof, land of the demons. This is the story of Lief Erricson the only one fast, and stupid, enough to make sure that supply lines between towns dont end like they did last time the Handrof attacked.

Make your way through wild lands to bring supplies, information, and hope back to the people of this land.

Planing to implement Vectors for inventory and also planning on using Queues for battles in some Final Fantasy 7esc turn based fighting.

5/12/2020 - Update

After my max priority queue not wanting to implement correctly I was forced to use the priority queue from our last assignment to get something in. My first town is operational, but needs a lot more work (I didn't realize how much work i had bitten off on having inventory and quests carry from scene to scene)

First Town has a quest set up, while the other towns are empty, also the battle scene isn't set up because I wasnt able to finish my code or even test it.
